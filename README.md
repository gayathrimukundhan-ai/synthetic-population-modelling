# Synthetic Population Modelling

This project is a web-based prototype for privacy-preserving synthetic population modeling, designed for pharmacy and grocer collaboration use cases.

## Features
- Pharmacy user flow: Upload, de-identify, analyze, generate, and export synthetic population data
- Modular dashboard UI (tab-based, scalable for grocer-side expansion)
- No backend required: all logic runs in the browser
- CSV-based data handling for maximum compatibility and demo acceptance

## Tech Stack
- React + TypeScript
- Material UI (MUI) for professional, responsive UI
- Open source libraries for CSV parsing and statistical analysis

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
3. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`
